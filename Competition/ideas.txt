# ideas for next session:

# Playing with Models
# elastic net model
# Random Forest
# Boosting
# Neural Net model
# Stacking

# Features selection / dimensionallity reduction
testing dim reduction techniques:
# SVD / PCA (same thing)
# Look up in the internet for other techniques
# is there any technique which bootstraping the feature selection?
# what are the measurements we can use to tell if a feature is usefull or not?


# Playing with features
# how to take advantage of dates?
# add genere of movie


# Conceptioal questions:
# How to tell if a model is bias dominant or variance dominant?
# If i know the question for the previous question, how can i use this information to improve the model?


# Other
# quantize back to valid if you sure about outcome (assign prob to each class and decide if it is worth it in MSE sense
  to quantize.

# add classification algorithm, samples with high likelyhood on a specific category, choose that catagory
(another way to think of quantization in a more 'statistical' way.




# Tasks
- modelling phase -
# elastic search model
# Random Forrest model
# Boosting model
# Stacking all the previous models
# NN model
# stacking with NN

- feature addition phase 1 -
# find a way to add dates features, test the effect on previous models.

- feature selection phase -
# use SVD for feature reduction, and test the effect on all of the previous models
# Look up for other feature reduction techniques and see the effect on previous models


- feature addition phase 2 -
# Look for other features to add (IMDB?) can take examples from the actual netflix prize competition.
